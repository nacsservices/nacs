## Empathy

**Curiosity. Understanding. Appreciation.** \
Giving people the benefit of the doubt and the respect that is due to them. Being human and recognising the humanity in others. Being understanding and appreciative.

## Courtesy

**Kindness. Generosity. Thoughtfulness.**\
Making an effort to save others time (everyone’s time is important, regardless of rank or title). Going the extra mile to make it easier for others; preparing in advance, anticipating needs. Being honest, humble and fair.

## Sustainable farming

Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

## Playfulness

**Open. Inviting. Receptive. Creative.**\
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practised by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

## Solidarity

**Unity. Mutual support. Cooperation.**\
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
