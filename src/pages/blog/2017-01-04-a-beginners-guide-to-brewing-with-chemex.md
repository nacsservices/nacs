Our culture turned inward creates our product; our culture turned outward creates our brand. Our brand is a  reflection of who we are as a company and what we represent in the world of work. If nothing else, our outward-facing brand should represent the best of what we bring to work as colleagues at this company. Smart, humble, hardworking and collaborative.

We are deliberately human—we aim to be an ideal colleague: One who works on the basis of respect and admiration for working people; someone who communicates in a way that is smart, humble, hardworking and collaborative. Who doesn’t dominate the conversation and never wastes your time; who knows the answer (and the context) if you have a question—and shows you how to find it yourself.

> We demonstrate our commitment to being customer centric by placing those humans at the centre of every communication, not ourselves.
